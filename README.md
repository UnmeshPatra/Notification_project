Notification Service
A scalable system to send notifications to users with support for multiple notification types and queue-based processing with automatic retries.
Features

RESTful API for sending and retrieving notifications
Support for multiple notification types (email, SMS, in-app)
Queue-based architecture for asynchronous notification processing
Automatic retry mechanism for failed notifications
MongoDB for persistent storage
Redis for queue management
Comprehensive error handling and logging
API documentation

Prerequisites

Node.js (v14+)
MongoDB
Redis

Installation

Clone the repository
bashgit clone <repository-url>
cd notification-service

Install dependencies
bashnpm install

Create a .env file in the project root and add the following:
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/notification-service
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379


Running the Application
Development Mode
bashnpm run dev
Production Mode
bashnpm start
API Endpoints
Send a Notification
POST /notifications
Request Body:
json{
  "userId": "123",
  "type": "email",
  "message": "Hello, this is a test notification!"
}
Get User Notifications
GET /users/:id/notifications
Get a Specific Notification
GET /notifications/:id
For complete API documentation, visit /api-docs when the server is running.
Architecture
Components

API Layer: Express.js application handling HTTP requests
Storage Layer: MongoDB for storing notification data
Queue Layer: Bull/Redis for handling asynchronous notification processing
Service Layer: Notification processors for different types (email, SMS, in-app)

Flow

Client sends a notification request to the API
API validates the request and stores the notification in MongoDB with status "queued"
API adds the notification to the processing queue and returns a success response
Queue processor picks up the notification and attempts to send it
If successful, the notification status is updated to "sent"
If failed, the system will retry up to the configured maximum attempts
After all retry attempts are exhausted, the notification is marked as "failed"

Retry Mechanism
Failed notifications are automatically retried according to the following configuration:

Maximum retry attempts: 3
Retry strategy: Exponential backoff
Initial retry delay: 10 seconds

Assumptions

Authentication and authorization are not implemented in this demo but should be added in a production environment
The notification senders are simulated and should be replaced with actual implementations (e.g., Nodemailer, Twilio)
Rate limiting is not implemented but should be considered for production
In a real-world scenario, you might want to add more detailed logs and monitoring
For a production deployment, consider containerizing the application with Docker

Future Improvements

Add user authentication and authorization
Implement real notification senders (email, SMS providers)
Add rate limiting
Add more detailed metrics and monitoring
Implement webhooks for notification status updates
Add support for scheduled notifications
Add support for templates
